# Calculator
This is a simple calculator designed with the help of HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavasScript.

## Introduction
The app is capable of performing basic arithematic calulations. The styling of the calculator is done primarily with the help of CSS Grid. I've also used media queries to make this website mobile responsive. The website was deployed with the help of Netlify. I have provided a link below to access the website.
